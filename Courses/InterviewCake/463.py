# Write a recursive function for generating all permutations of an input string. Return them as a set.
# Don't worry about time or space complexityâ€”if we wanted efficiency we'd write an iterative version.
# To start, assume every character in the input string is unique.
# Your function can have loopsâ€”it just needs to also be recursive.
